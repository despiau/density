      <td>THE app of all time</td>
      <td>"I don’t know how it’s possible, but I believe this is the best application, apart from a few others that I would consider close matches to Sizzle.<br><br>This is due to the first nature of this app: free education. Nearly every app, no matter how simple, content-filled, and educational an education app is, this one is completely free. In this day and age where corporate greed fuels rising prices on education, apps like these with free resources like these may actually form the backbone for the reduction in educative costs.<br><br>There is nothing this app can’t do that other education apps can do. The quality is remarkable. I can’t describe how happy I am to have discovered this while doomscrolling on Instagram.<br><br>Please keep up the good work!!!"</td>

Its AI-powered assistance has significantly improved my understanding of complex topics and boosted my grades. The interface is user-friendly, and the responses are always prompt and insightful.<br><br>However, I earnestly plead with the developers not to implement an update that restricts the range of answers provided. Many similar apps have followed this path, ultimately leading to subscription models or paywalls that deter users. Maintaining the accessibility and functionality of Sizzle without imposing financial barriers would ensure its continued success and popularity among students like myself."</td>

It got all of them correct except for one that it did slightly incorrectly (it misplaced like one variable). I don’t expect it to always be perfect, but it gives step by step instructions, is free, and can solve a bunch of word problems on the fly, which is all you can really ask for. I’ll continue experimenting with this but I definitely would recommend.</td>

      <td>AMAZING APP, PLEASE BUYY🩷🩷</td>
      <td>I was a bit skeptical of buying this app at first because it didn’t have many reviews, but after reading the very thoughtful reviews, I decided to give it a try especially the fact that people said that you didn’t have to pay for it which is something that a lot of apps lack. I decided to give her to go after seeing one of the ads on TikTok, and after using this app for only two questions, this app is absolutely AMAZINGG🫶 not only does it give you the answers, but actually takes you step-by-step by you answering some of the questions and if you don’t know the answer, then you can just tell it to give you the answer. This app is incredibly great despite the fact that you don’t have to pay for any subscriptions, or game passes. This is by far the best app for math or physics. TYSM FOR THIS APPPP😺😺</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Was good new update made it bad</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Finally an app that can actually help you without making you pay😭</td>
      <td>I’ve been using it recently, and it helped me more than I expected. The only thing I would say is that once I get into the app, it automatically pops up the camera for you to take a picture of the problem. There are some of the problems that I’ll have to type it out because it doesn’t necessarily asked the question. Hope later on there could be a version where it allows you to just type the question instead of just taking a camera of the problem. Other than that, I can’t complain☺️</td>

      <td>Sizzle is such a wonderful app! It not only solves word problems for you but also solves equations and a bunch of other stuff too! And the best thing is: Sizzle is totally free! You don’t have to pay any subscriptions or annual fee in order to see the answers, it’s all free! And another great thing about it is how it has different options for you when the answers pop up, which is absolutely awesome! I’ve tried out about 10 other apps and all of them either don’t solve word problems or needs subscriptions as soon as you open it. Overall, I’d give this app a 10/10 and I hope it remains the same in the future (meaning that I don’t want this apps to be given subscriptions cuz I don’t have the money to pay for it) and I really hope that it gets to be very popular in the future!</td>
