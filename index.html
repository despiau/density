I'd love to see note integration into courses. Yes I can make a course from photos of notes but I don't see an option to add to an existing course. Also the courses seem to lack examples unless you ask the AI to give examples. Overall great for checking answers and step by step feedback on how to get to the answer with useful information.

This app is very helpful. It doesn't just do the equation. It actually teaches you and shows you the steps and doesn't correct you the first time it allows you to make your own corrections. I believe that it is a good tool for studying for finals and just tests in general. It's very helpful and it's not just memorization. It's actual learning and it's teaching me better than my teacher did. Love this app!

This app is absolutely INSANE. 10/10. The main reason why i downloaded it is because theres no ads, no paywalls, no nothing, its FREE. It is EXTREMELY easy to use, and very very very helpful. I am very happy. You guys working at Sizzle are some geniuses. I wanted to learn some chemistry, got introduced to new things, and i can learn everything about that with the click of a button. Absolutely AWESOME. Would recommend to anyone. This may be the only app that actually helps me with school. Thanks.

Totally Superb. I was skeptic to find an educational and totally free app like this ... but sizzle proved me wrong. I'm comforted after years days and years of anxiety. I'm not a money guy. But now, I literally learn anything. It even creates customized courses. It has Amazing features that comes with ABSOLUTELY NO cost.

Literally nothing is wrong with the app, although it could be nice if there was an option to add material or content and build on the course ! And ofc stuff like more technical quizzes, images and graphs...Absolutely life saving 💗

Hi Jennifer, have you tried out the Doc Upload feature for adding your study material? Working on images and graphs :)

It's really helpful but the only thing I wanna suggest that please also add the graphs so because when it comes to physics and chemistry only explanation is not enough so it would be more effective for learners if u add pictures and graphs . Thank you for making this app: )

Am not payed to say this but this app is amazing to me. I really enjoy when using it to sovle my academic problem. I really congrats them for making such an amazing app. I recommend others to download this app and you will not regret it at all. As the fact nothing is perfect in this world we all know that so i might say that there might be some small issues like u cant include a letter when editing the question but it good and if they fix this it will be better hope to see changes thank you.

This app is my personal best I've seen when it comes to giving help with homework schoolwork. It doesn't stop at Maths and Science questions but gives answers to any question it can. It also explains the step by step of how the final answer was gotten making it easier for you to understand why that's the answer Note that it doesn't teach you from scratch but helps you build on the knowledge you should already have. Either ways, the app is perfect and best of all "FREE"

Great app for learning overall, but it's missing graphical illustrations in courses and problems. For example, in the conic sections of math, not a single problem has a visual aid, which affects understanding. I suggest adding illustrations wherever possible.

Quick test The model is very impressive and seems well optimized. I presented it with a few problems from Math and Physics. It handled logic and pure calculations brilliantly. The steps are accurate and intuitive to follow. Sometimes it shows trivial steps but that is fine. It got one problem wrong (on a technicality) and is thus still acceptable. It cannot handle diagrams. (Which is ok since it's a beta feature!) Overall, very good showing and I would happily pay for it.

Great app, good experience using it,user friendly, solved all my problems in maths, physics. Great use of images to text feature. Edit: one problem is there sometimes choices are not given correct and when I choose incorrect option, it reports "wrong answer.." but there the correct answer is written. For example if correct answe is 39Unit, it's not present in the options sometimes and when I click on incorrect choice ( for ex 38Units ) it will say correct answer is 39Units. 😶

Amazing app, great step by step explanations, however, there are times when the answer given is wrong like, the answer's perfect around 80% of the times but in the remaining 20% some or the other minor mistakes that the WI makes which makes the given answer wrong. Also, another thing that I feel missing is that it doesn't give diagramatic form of answers (such as graphs, flowcharts, pictures etc). If that could be added then the app would be, more or less, flawless.

I was using the older version of this app and it worked very well,never disappointed. Then I had problems with signing up, I had to un-install nd re-install. But now this new version of the app that's been spruced up is👎💩. The app works but the answers it gives are not accurate . I saw a review complaining about the same issue but I didn't trust it cause the older version never gave me problems. If u do not fix the problem u will lose users.

It is the best app for learning. It gives steps on the way to go about the problem.

And also be able to capture diagram from the photos taken. However it is the best app I have ever used

It doesn't solve the problems with references from other popular trusted books written by professionals that's why sometimes it gives incorrect answers...so try to checkout how to manage this but sincerely the app is good and has great vision to ensure improving scholars field of studies.

Sizzle has helped me with so many school problems. Obviously I don't use this app exclusively when doing school work. But when stuck with writers block, or can't quite get the next step of a math problem, sizzle is there to help you along. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because on occasion it misinterprets a math problem and gives the wrong solution.

Generally such powerful AI apps come at a cost of a subscription but this one is free, atleast as of yet, if it remains completely free, this might as well be crowned as the best AI tutor.. seriously the AI genuinely good, compared with copilot, which can't solve basic chem questions, this one, being solely based on studying, is miles ahead in that sector, would absolutely recommend

And it's not 100% correct as it doesn't give accurate answers all the time, that's why I didn't give the 5 🌟 but as a user of this app take "sizzle" as an assistant where by u won't expect 100% from it.

sizzle is the first and best mathematics solver l have ever used.

1)It cannot solve a lot of problems in math including sums related to complex roots. 2) It is not helpful when the question is diagram based. Overall the ai is really good but there's more to cover up

The best app to those who all are weak in math. This app will never show ypu the answer until you try it on your own this app made me mathematics very easy. No bad review about this app. Loved it but one thing is that it cannot solve any triangular problems unless that it's very good

Worst experience. I usually don't write reviews but this one, this app is so bad in maths that even I (the one with the worst math grades in my class) is able to tell that the answers are wrong. Instead of telling me another solution for solving a basic question that is 27/40 the app is telling me that both of them doesn't have a common factor so it couldn't be solved further. Tf is wrong with people giving 5 star reviews to this waste telling that this app is nice blah blah, paid mf actors.
